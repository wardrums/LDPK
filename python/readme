Python bindings are new in version 1.6.

There is a precompiled module named lens_distortion_plugins.so
in directory linux or osx. When you import this module, you have
access to the five built-in lens distortion plugins. The python
online help will give you some details how to use it, and there
is a test program test_lens_distortion_plugins.py. If the python
version or OS version do not meet your requirements please compile
the module yourself (not difficult), starting with the make-scripts
in $LDPK/script.

If you have questions or want to report a bug, please write to

Thanks,

Uwe
